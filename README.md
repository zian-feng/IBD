# Gene Expression & Disease Classification
> Can gene expression data identify patients with inflammatory bowel disease?

This project, originally introduced as a case study in 2017 by the Statistical Society of Canada, explores the use of gene expression data as a biomarker to classify & identify patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goal is to enhance the IBD Classification Model through the application of machine learning algorithms and advanced statistical methods such as Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines.
